### How It Works
GradeFlux follows a clear, step-by-step workflow to ensure teachers can grade efficiently and students receive meaningful feedback.

#### Workflow Overview
1. **Teacher Authentication**: Teachers log in using their Google account via OAuth or use the test login option.
2. **Course Selection**: Teachers pick a course from their Google Classroom or test data.
3. **Assignment Selection**: Teachers select an assignment to grade from the chosen course.
4. **Answer Key Setup**: Teachers create or modify the answer key for the selected assignment.
5. **Automated Grading**: The system grades MCQs by comparing student answers to the answer key, calculates scores, and generates feedback.
6. **Performance Analytics**: Teachers view statistics and grade distribution for the class.
7. **Teacher Review**: Teachers review grades and feedback in a dashboard, with the option to edit if needed.
8. **Sync to Classroom**: Approved grades and feedback are synced back to Google Classroom.

#### Detailed Workflow
- **Step 1: Authentication**
  - Teachers log in using Google OAuth.
  - Alternatively, they can use the test login option to explore the app with mock data.
  - The system verifies their identity and links to their Google Classroom account.
- **Step 2: Course Selection**
  - GradeFlux fetches a list of courses from Google Classroom.
  - Teachers select one to access its assignments.
  - Courses are displayed in an attractive card-based layout with hover effects.
- **Step 3: Assignment Selection**
  - The system displays all assignments for the selected course.
  - Teachers choose an assignment to grade.
  - Assignments show details like due date and submission status.
- **Step 4: Answer Key Setup**
  - Teachers create or modify the answer key for the selected assignment.
  - They can add or remove questions as needed.
  - The interface provides a clean form for entering correct answers.
- **Step 5: Automated Grading**
  - For each student submission:
    - Parses MCQ answers.
    - Compares them to the teacher-provided answer key.
    - Assigns a score (e.g., 8/10).
    - Generates personalized feedback based on performance.
- **Step 6: Performance Analytics**
  - The dashboard displays:
    - Class average score
    - Highest and lowest scores
    - Grade distribution chart
    - Visual indicators of performance levels
- **Step 7: Teacher Review**
  - A dashboard displays student names, scores, and feedback.
  - Teachers can tweak grades or feedback manually.
  - Student information includes avatars and late submission indicators.

      total = len(answer_key)
      percentage = (score/total) * 100
      
      # Generate personalized feedback based on performance
      if percentage >= 90:
          feedback = "Excellent work! You've mastered this material."
      elif percentage >= 80:
          feedback = "Great job! You have a solid understanding of the concepts."
      elif percentage >= 70:
